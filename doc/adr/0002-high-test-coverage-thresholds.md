# 2. High test coverage thresholds

Date: 2020-04-09

## Status

Status: Accepted on 2020-04-09

## Context

* This is Open Source app which may be used by big variety of projects
* We want to have this app stable and safe
* @kopach, as main contributor and author of this lib treats this project as place, where best practices should met

## Decision

We'll use 100% coverage threshold for all source code written in this project

## Consequences

* All current and future PR's will fail without 100% code coverage
* This change may require more time and knowledge on writing particular feature
* Everyone contributing to this project in form of functionality, will gain additional benefit as practice in writing unit tests
* This change should not stop people contributing to the project without test. PR will fail, but other contributors should be able to help with tests if needed.
